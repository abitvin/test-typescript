Test
====
A small good enough (for me) unit tester written in TypeScript.

Building
--------
This project is build within Visual Studio Code and a installation of TypeScript 1.8 in the default directory.
If your install path of TypeScript is different then the default path then you should change the path in the ".vscode/tasks.json" file.
If everything is set, just press CTRL+SHIFT+B to build.
